# Software Architecture Document 
# 1.	Introduction <a name="introduction">
The introduction of the Software Architecture Document provides an overview of the entire Software Architecture Document. It includes the purpose, scope, definitions, acronyms, abbreviations, references, and overview of the Software Architecture Document.
## 1.1	Purpose
This document provides a comprehensive architectural overview of the system, using a number of different architectural views to depict different aspects of the system. It is intended to capture and convey the significant architectural decisions which have been made on the system.

## 1.2	Scope
This document describes the architecture of the mobile application from the OneTouch project including all necessary infrastructure.

## 1.5	Overview
All necessary architectural details will be described in the following sections. This includes a database diagram, which gives an overview about the project structure.
Furthermore, the architectural representation, goals and constraints are clarified in this document.
# 2.	Architectural Representation 
The OneTouch application will consist of an application working directly on the rasberry pi and an application for mobiles. The mobile application will be developed in C# in Xamarin. Both applications will be using a SQL database. The SAD will describe the Architecture of the mobile app. 

the mvvm architecture in Xamarin:

# 3.	Architectural Goals and Constraints 
Xamarin uses a Model-View-Viewmodel- architecture. This should lead to a clear distinction between data, logic and views.
We used the MVVM-Light toolkit by Galasoft.

# 4.	Use-Case View

To look at the detailed Use Case descritions please visit the [SRS](https://github.com/TheLordXII/OneTouch/blob/master/SRS.md).

# 5.	Logical View 
## 5.1	Overview
There is no tool to generate a class diagramm out of a .NET Standard project. Therefore we took a picture of our classes.
There are folders for the models ("FÃ¼r mich bist du einfach kein Model"), the views and the viewmodels. Additionally we are using services for the business logic and communication with the database.

# 11.	Quality 
We are using Jenkins as an ci tool to ensure a high quality of our development process. Whenever there is a new commit to a pull request or the master branch it automatically builds the project. The Jenkins build result will be displayed in a badge on Github.
In addition we use Codacy to ensure the code quality. Each pull request/commit is checked.The code quality is also displayed in a badge on Github.
For the Backend we use Postman to test the REST API calls. This is also automated and can be run through all Testcases.
